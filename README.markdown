This is just a mirror of
[thrift.vim](https://raw.github.com/twitter/thrift/master/contrib/thrift.vim)
because I like submodules so much. Hopefully others find it useful.

This is from the 0.9.x release.


## Installation ##

I use this with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
Once you have that installed, you can simply:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/theevocater/thrift.vim.git

Next time you open a thrift file it should be nicely syntax-d.
